Module 3 Project

My submission for the course project in Coursera - Module 3. The "run_analysis.R" does the following:

1) Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory

2) Load the activity, training and test data as well as the feature info

3) Combines training and test data sets in one dataframe

4) Renaming columns to the feature info, subject replaced to activity labels

5) Keeps only the mean and standard deviation columns

6) Expands the names in feature info for readability

7)Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

8) The end result is produced in the file tidy.txt.
