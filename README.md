Module 3 Project

My submission for the course project in Coursera - Module 3. The "run_analysis.R" does the following:

*Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
*Load the activity, training and test data as well as the feature info
*Combines training and test data sets in one dataframe
*Renaming columns to the feature info, subject replaced to activity labels
*Keeps only the mean and standard deviation columns
*Expands the names in feature info for readability
*Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
*The end result is produced in the file tidy.txt.
